# About this repository
These are some experiments with Processing.js. As I develop more sketches, I might upload them here.

# How to run
The base.html file is the html file that should be run in a web browser. The canvas element contains a `data-processing-sources` attribute that contains a reference to the sketch to be executed. Change this attribute to run a different sketch.

# Notes
There's a simple javascript function to download the sketch as an image in base.html.
